# letter-recognition-neuralnet

A simple neural network that uses array indexing to recognize letters as "L" or "H." Data set was hand produced for letters used for training and testing through adding random noise to pre-determined L/H arrays.

L/H Arrays are 1D, 12 element lists that form a 3x4 representation of an image. 1 implies that a pixel is turned on, while 0 is off.
